# ilius
What is Ilius?
Ilius is a game that teaches you how to use more intermediate functions of the UNIX command line.

Ilius has managed to find his way onto your computer, but he needs help. Can you help him accomplish his goals?

Ilius is heavily work in progress, but he will be glad to meet all of you when he's done!

Dev note: Ilius only currently works on my computer, as he requires scripts that I have created. Once he is further into development, there will be a public beta to play... but for now, this all I have.
